This project takes in links to npm/github project repositories and returns with a list of metrics to allow the user to make a decision on if they want to use that repository or not.

Run instructions:
1. clone this repository and add a .env file with your github token
2. ./run install will install all necessary dependencies
3. ./run *URL_FILE_PATH* where URL_FILE_PATH is the link to a text file which contains all github/npm repos that you would like the metrics for
